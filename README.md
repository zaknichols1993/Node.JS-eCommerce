# Express.Js eCommerce Hat Shop.

A Node.Js/Express.Js eCommerce application. This was a proof of concept project to prototype an eCommerce solution in Node.Js. It's fairly simple to spin up a server, implement Stripe, and in no time you can have a full-fledged shopping cart. I love Node.Js and it's ecosystem.

## Final Thoughts

* I'll always give a thumbs up for JavaScript. I enjoy writing applications in express and it's libraries. This project has a lot of potential with some marketing and a cleaner/better UI/UX
* This project will more than likely never go live, but it served it's purpose. Which was to demonstrate how easy it is to set up an online shop.
